# MakersBnB specification

We would like a web application that allows users to list spaces they have available, and to hire spaces for the night.

### Headline specifications
1. Any signed-up user can list a new space.
2. Users can list multiple spaces.
3. Users should be able to name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.
4. Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available.
5. Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night, and this should be approved by the user that owns that space.
6. Nights for which a space has already been booked should not be available for users to book that space.
7. Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night.

### User stories
```
As a user
So that I can add new spaces
I want to list a property

As a user
So that I have a profile that remembers me
I want to log in

As a user
So that I can market my property
I would like to have provide information on my space 
(Name, description, price per night)

As a user
So that I can see availabilty 
I would like to offer a range of dates to book

As a user
So that I have control over my bookings
I can accept or decline the request to book

As a user
So that double booking is avoided
The property can not be booked if it is already booked

In development:
As part of the booking system
So that I can still book a property which is not yet confirmed 
I can book a property which is pending confirmation
